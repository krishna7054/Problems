Question 1: Hash Map Implementation
Description:
Implement a basic hash map (associative array) that supports the following operations:

- put(key, value): Inserts a key-value pair into the hash map. If the key already exists, update the value.
- get(key): Returns the value associated with the key, or -1 if the key does not exist.
- remove(key): Removes the key-value pair from the hash map if it exists.
